the verses will be named "verse"
followed by a number that identifies the verse
followed by a number that identifies thematic relationship with other verses
and another number that encodes rhyming with some other verse

example:
    separator is '-', could be anything ...
Limerick
 verse-1-0-0 // verse id = 1, related to 0 (none), rhymes with 0 (none)
 verse-2-1-1 // verse id = 2, related to 1, rhymes with 1
 verse-3-0-0 // verse id = 3, related to none, rhymes with none
 verse-4-3-3 // verse id = 4, related to 3, rhymes with 3
 verse-5-4-1 // verse id = 5, related to 4, thymes with 1

so something like:
Limerick = verse-1-0-0 nl verse-2-1-1 nl verse-3-0-0 nl verse-4-3-3 nl verse-5-4-1;

'nl' means newline


Then ... according to this cfg the "Poem" or "Lyrics" class would generate the
words.
Then the harmonizer would recieve each verse and pass it through a cfg of it's own
that describes chords in a particular style or fashion.
the length of each chord progression would be constrained by the length of each
"verse" or sentence.

hipotetical example of a harmony cfg:
verse-1-0-0
verse = ((T | tt) | (SD | D)) etc ... whatever
the thing is each harmonizer implementation would confom to a given "key"
like verse
or chorus or A B A B etc
