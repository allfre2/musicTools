# musicTools

This library is intended to be used to do general musical analysis and computation.
It contains several classes that model music theory concepts and facilitates
operations such as finding relations between chords, scale and single notes.
I'm in the process of adding classes that generate lyrics, poems, etc ...
using markov chains and algorithms for finding `rhymes` and or `similar sounding words` such as soundex, metaphone and others.
It implements a simple Context Free Grammar class that is to be used to create
context free grammars for songs, chord progressions, melodies and other musical structures and then generate random examples of sentences that fit those grammars.
It's still a scribble so ... let's be patient.
